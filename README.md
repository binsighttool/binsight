# binsight
BinSight Tool - APK files analysis and reverse engineering

This branch was created specifically for Euro S&P 2018 submission. Although, the application compiles, it lacks documentation (WIP) and comments in certain parts.

The code is currently being refactorred.

Note to reviewers, we called the project initially APKInsight, hence the file naming. We are refactorring it to a proper BinSight namespace at the moment.
